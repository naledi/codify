			Well I made it 1200 miles already and I passed through some intersting places on the way:
		</p>
		<ol>
		 	<li>Walla Walla, AW</li> 
		 	<li>Magic City, ID</li>
			<li>Bountifull UT</li> 
		 	<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
		 	<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
		 	<li>Why, AZ</li>
		</ol>

			I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
		</p>
		 <blockquote>
		 	Passing cars,<br>
		  	When you cant see,<br>
		  	May get,<br>
		  	A glimps,<br>
		  	Of eternity.<br>
		  </blockquote>
		<p>
			I definatly won't be passing any cars.
		</p>

			My first day of the trip? can't beleave I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
		</p>
		<ul> 
			<li>cellphone, iPod</li>
			<li>digital camera</li>
			<li>and protein bar</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		 	Just the essentials. Also Lau Tzu would have said, <q>A Journy of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
